Control your home-automation devices from a customizable touchscreen UI connected via MQTT.

This project is a re-implementation of the popular HASwitchPlate sketch created by aderusha.
The [HASPone][1] project uses a Wemos D1 mini and requires a Nextion/TJC HMI display.
This rewrite removes the Nextion/TJC hardware requirement by using the [Light and Versatile Graphics Library][2] on the MCU to drive a commodity display.

openHASP uses the ESP32 and STM32F4 to take advantage of the hardware capabilities.
